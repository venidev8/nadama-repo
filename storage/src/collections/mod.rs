//! Lazy data structures for storage access where elements are not all loaded
//! into memory. This serves to minimize gas costs, avoid unbounded iteration
//! in some cases, and ease the validation of storage changes in VPs.
//!
//! Rather than finding the diff of the state before and after (which requires
//! iteration over both of the states that also have to be decoded), VPs will
//! just receive the storage sub-keys that have experienced changes without
//! having to check any of the unchanged elements.
